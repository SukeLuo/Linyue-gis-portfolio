# About me

Hi! My name is Linyue Luo, and you can call me Suke(as Su-ki). I’m currently a second year student from Master of Urban Design Program. I always use ArcGIS Pro for analysis when I work on a background research for my design work, and I’m also interested in it a lot. Hopefully you can find a lot of cool things here.

# What I hope to learn

Create neat and beautiful map;

Produce real product.
